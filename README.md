# CardPricer
Gets Magic The Gathering card price and name and totals in a pandas dataframe

The correct way to input multiple cards is by putting:

```[amount] [card name] [amount]```

**(Note that you can specify the amount either before or after the card name)**

This is just a personal project for myself, you're free to do whatever you want with it!

**PIP packages used in project:**
- https://pypi.org/project/sf-price-fetcher/ to pull latest pricing from scryfall
- https://pypi.org/project/CurrencyConverter/ (updates currencies once a day afaik)
- https://pypi.org/project/pandas/ for the dataframe
